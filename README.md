Game Title: Earth Arcade - A 2D progressive arcade game experience that combines all the fun mini-games with lessons in environmental awareness. Players enter the game and progress through levels, each representing a simple eco-friendly action such as throwing trash properly, planting, and fishing trash out the ocean. By tying gameplay to real-world habits, the game promotes sustainability and healthy practices in an engaging way. The progressive design keeps players motivated while reinforcing the message that small actions, when continued over time, can make a big difference for health, wellbeing, and the planet.
